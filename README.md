# UNIVERSITY ASSIGNMENT ON PATTERN RECOGNITION <h1>

SPRING SEMESTER 2016

We were asked to do an assignment on simple pattern recognition algorithms via using Matlab.

* A. we had to randomly generate 500 points in 2D space. 400 of them would belong tothe first class and the rest on the second.
   The given space for class 1 was [2,8]x[1,2] and for the second [6,8]x[2.5,5.5].
   
* B. 
     * B2. Euclidian distance algorithm 
     * B3. Mahalanobis distance algorithm
     * B4. Bayesian Classifier

* C. 
     * C1. Use the PCA trasformation
     * C2. Euclidian distance algorithm on the PCA transformation
     * C3. LDA trasformation
     * C4. Euclidian distance algorithm on the LDA transformation
   
* D. 
     * D1. Mean square error aglorithm
     * D2. Perceptron algorithm
